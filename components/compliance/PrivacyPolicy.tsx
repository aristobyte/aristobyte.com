            Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile

            setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to
            have data about your online browsing activities monitored and
            collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for
            recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As
            such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any
            other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to
            be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that
            we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice
